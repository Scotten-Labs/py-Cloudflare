## About

API for Cloudflare written in Python. Mostly being made becasue I tried the official one and oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh my that is one mess of code imho. 

This will use the Python Requests module and will folow all of the Cloudflare API [docs](https://api.cloudflare.com/). 

This project will officially begin once I have complete my py-dyndns which I *was* going to use the Cloudflare API for and have decided its garbage.
