## About

API for Cloudflare written in Python. Mostly being made becasue I tried the official one and oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh my that is one mess of code imho. 

This project will officially begin once I have complete my py-dyndns which I *was* going to use the Cloudflare API for and have decided its garbage.
